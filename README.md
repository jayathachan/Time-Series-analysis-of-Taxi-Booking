# Time-Series-analysis-of-Taxi-Booking

## Description
This project conducts a time series analysis of hourly taxi order volume over a period of six months. The main tasks of the project are as follows:
- Identify trends and/or seasonality
- Engineer new features based on the results of the time series analysis
- Scale/normalize training data
- Train and evaluate a prediction model for the given regression task

## Introduction
We will train and evaluate a regression model for a taxi company that will predict the amount of taxi orders needed at airports in the next hour. The RMSE metric will be used for the test evaluation.

## Dataset
**taxi.csv**
- *datetime:* date (YYYY-MM-DD) and time (HH:MM:SS)
- *num_orders:* number of orders
